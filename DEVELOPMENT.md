# How to develop this piece of software.

Download the free vmware runner and install
ubuntu server using the default image. Select `minimal virtual maschine`,
select `install ssh server`
(don't use vmware user / host setup)

- Create a user `user` with password `pass` (the password will be removed later)

## The provision script

Then, login to the image using ssh as user and  run this script:

````
sudo apt-get install -y git && cd /tmp/ && sudo git clone https://github.com/infracamp/kickguest-win10-vmware.git && sudo bash /tmp/kickguest-win10-vmware/provision/install.sh
````


## Descision about preinstalled packages

- Why do we need `whois`-Package?

The `mkpasswd`-script is located inside to create strong hashed
passwords. You'll need strongly hashed passwords everywhere in public
cloud infrastructure - so we'll make it easy to create hashes.

- What's about `open-vm-tools`?

This is used to mount the host filesystems into the container.
